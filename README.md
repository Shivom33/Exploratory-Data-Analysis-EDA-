# Exploratory-Data-Analysis (EDA) 

Welcome to my SQL-based Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project! 🚀
This project demonstrates how we can analyze data stored in a relational database using only SQL queries — no Python or R required.

📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to explore data stored in a Data Warehouse Analytics database and generate meaningful insights using SQL.
It covers multiple phases of EDA, including:

Data Exploration – Understanding tables, columns, and database structure.

Dimension Exploration – Analyzing dimensions like customers, products, and dates.

Measures Exploration – Calculating key business metrics such as sales, orders, and customers.

Magnitude Analysis – Looking at totals, averages, and revenue across different dimensions.

Ranking Analysis – Identifying top and bottom performers (products & customers).

🗂️ Data Used

The project is based on three tables under the gold schema:

dim_customers – Customer details (demographics, location, etc.)

dim_products – Product details (category, cost, etc.)

fact_sales – Sales transactions (orders, dates, quantities, revenues)

🚀 How to Use

Clone this repository.

Run the SQL script in your SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).

Make sure the required tables (gold.dim_customers, gold.dim_products, gold.fact_sales) are already loaded with data.

Execute the script step by step to view results.
